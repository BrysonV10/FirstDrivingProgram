# FirstDrivingProgram
This is our first driving program. There should be more info found in our notebook. We are just getting started with our new year. 
Due to the fact that my teamates obviously don't know how to use GitHub, I will add a quick tutorial below.
Click on the Main button above to add/go to another branch. If you are adding a new program, add it to another branch. If you are updating the code, make a branch from the branch where you got the code from the version before. If a program completely works, go to Pull Requests and request to pull an off-branch into either another branch or the Main branch.
